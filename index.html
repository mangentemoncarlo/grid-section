					“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition
					and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
					and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
					most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
					working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

				</h2>
				<p class="card__text--light">
					“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
					professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
					student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
					staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
					agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
					that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example
					of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
					receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
